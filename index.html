        <p>
          Welcome to the free online version of the award-winning game show “<strong> Wants to Be a Millionaire?</strong>”. The show has aired for
          nearly two decades and produced an impressive list of instant-millionaires. And now the free online version offers everyone the same chance
          to succeed in turning knowledge into real wealth. <br />The game is open to anyone willing to put their knowledge to the test in a series of
          questions and answers. Just keep your wits about you, have fun, and get rich! So if you’re in the mood to make a quick million dollars for
          yourself, this is your chance.<br />
          The game consists of 15 questions. The level of difficulty increases with each question, and so does your potential wealth. For example, if
          you answer the first question correctly your prize money goes from $100 to $1000. As you work your way through the questions by supplying
          the correct answers your riches grow exponentially until you reach the final question - and if you answer it correctly you will succeed in
          making a million dollars! <br />Keep in mind that your intellect and knowledge are the keys to success. Think you’ve got what it takes? Then
          go ahead and play! Put all those random facts you’ve collected over the years to good use and turn it into a quick and easy million dollars.
